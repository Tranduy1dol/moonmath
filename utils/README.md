# Utils

---

This folder contains utility functions for the project. The functions are organized into different files based on their 
functionality.

List of files:

- `elliptic_curve_operations.rs`: Contains functions for performing operations on elliptic curves.
- `modular_operations.rs`: Contains functions for performing modular arithmetic operations.
- `extended_gcd.rs`: Contains functions for computing the extended greatest common divisor (GCD).

Each module provides a set of functions that can be used throughout the project to perform specific mathematical 
operations.
