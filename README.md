# MoonMath

---

This is my note and exercise repository for the book "[Moonmath Manual](https://leastauthority.com/community-matters/moonmath-manual/)".
Also have my code to implement the exercises and the algorithms that introduced in the book.

## Test

---

Run the tests with:

```bash
cargo test
```

## Improvements

---

Since this repository is a personal note, I may not cover all the exercises in the book. Also some of my implementations may not be optimal or correct.
In future, I will try to optimize the code and cover more exercises.
